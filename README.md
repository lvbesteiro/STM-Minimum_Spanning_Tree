# STM-Minimum_Spanning_Tree
This Python script analyzes the degree of order in two-dimensional (2D) polymers from STM experimental images.

It was used in the preparation of Refs. [1,2]. Additional information about its output and methodology, as well as references to previous related work, can be found either in Ref. [1] or in the supplementary information of Ref. [2].
